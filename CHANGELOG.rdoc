Added ModuleCluster::Define::Status to interrogate currently defined hooks.

Added ModuleCluster::Suspend, which includes various methods to temporarily or

Added set names, which permit the later suspension of sets by name rather than having to
describe which set(s) should be suspended (although this can also be done).
